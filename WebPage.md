Gonna try to make this Page with just tailwind for now, might have to use a react framework later for more features
Probably going to host it on GitHub on Vercel free tier? (need to compare options)
functionality for now (as the app is not ready)
- presenting the functionnality of the sample recorder
- give the user an option to sign up to a mailing list to receive updates

Run this commend for the tailwind to build with the changes
```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i input.css -o output.css --watch
```
